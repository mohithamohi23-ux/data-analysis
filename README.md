## Sales Data Analysis Using Python

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
I performed data loading, cleaning, grouping, and visualized the results with bar charts.

## Steps Completed 
1. Loaded CSV file using Pandas
2. Checked data shape, info, and missing values
3. Generated summary statistics
4. Calculated:
   - Total sales by Product
   - Total sales by Region
5. Created bar charts for both analyses

## Files Included
- analysis.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook with all code
- sales.csv — Dataset used for analysis
- README.md — Documentation of the project

## How to Run
1. Install Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib
2. Open project folder in VS Code
3. Open `analysis.ipynb`
4. Run all cells
